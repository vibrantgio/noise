Package noise implements Perlin and Simplex noise functions.

Adapted from https://github.com/josephg/noisejs/blob/master/perlin.js

This code was placed in the public domain by its original developer,
Stefan Gustavson. You may use it as you see fit, but attribution
is appreciated.

The code is a conversion to Go. Each noise is a struct type with a
constructor that takes a seed and a `Noise` method: `NewPerlin2D`,
`NewPerlin3D`, `NewSimplex2D` and `NewSimplex3D` return `*Perlin2D`,
`*Perlin3D`, `*Simplex2D` and `*Simplex3D`.

## For coding assistants

Read the org guide before you write code against this module: the plan
root's [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/vibrantgio/organisation/blob/master/AGENTS.md).

The build and test commands are reached from that file.

The four `TestImage*` tests draw a noise image and compare its PNG encoding
byte for byte with `ref_p2d.png`, `ref_p3d.png`, `ref_s2d.png` and
`ref_s3d.png`, which the tests embed. To regenerate those reference images,
set `write_reference_image` to `true` in `noise_test.go`, run
`go test -run TestImage .` (each test then writes its image next to its source
file), set the constant back to `false`, and run `go test ./...` again: the
first run still compares against the images embedded before the write.
